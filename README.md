=============
The twitter part of Team 1 at nodecopter in Helsinki. 

The controlling part was coded in processing, which would save images and status info from the drone as files. This script then tweeted on two ocasions: When someone tweeted to the 'drone' on twitter, it would answer you with an image file from the camera right now - and also it was listening to changes on a text file that the processing script could update.

The twitter handle of the drone is @saunadrone (https://twitter.com/saunadrone)
